    "Q1 what is the difference between interpreted and compiled language\n",
    " ->1 compiled language - the source code is transformed  all at once into machine code by a compiler\n",
    "    - the program runs directly on the hardware arter compilation\n",
    "    - usually faster speed because it is alredy in machine code\n",
    "    2 intepreted language- source code is read and executed line by line by interpreter\n",
    "     - it does not produce standart machine code file it relies on the interpretr\n",
    "     - speed usully slower because the code is transleted on the fly\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 what is exception handling in python\n",
    " -> exception handling is the process of catching errors so your program does not crash\n",
    "    and respond gracefully(exception is an error that occur during program execution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 what is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
    "  ->the finally block in python is used to gurantee that certain code runs no matter what \n",
    "    whether an exception occurs or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 what is logging in python\n",
    " -> logging is the process of rocording messages from a program while it runs\n",
    "   -these messages can help track what the program is doing debug errors or monitor performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5 what is the significance of the __del__method in python\n",
    " -> clean up resource- used to external resources held by the object such as files network\n",
    "    funalization logic-execute last min operation before an object is destroyed\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6 what is differnce between import and from_import in python\n",
    "->  imort- it imports the whole module to access function or variable you must prefix them with module \n",
    "           name\n",
    "    from__import- it import only a specific function class or variable from the module \n",
    "    you can use it directly without the module name\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7 how you cam handle multiple exception in python\n",
    "-> you can catch differnt exception together using a tuple\n",
    "  - handling multiple exception separately you can write differnt except block for each exception\n",
    "   - using generic except\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8 what is the purpose of the with statment when handling files in pyton\n",
    "  -> python automatilly closes the file when the block even if an exception occurs\n",
    "     increase code readybility , safe and cleaner\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9 what is difference between multithreading amd multiprocessing\n",
    " -> multithreading- uses threas within the same process\n",
    "    -threads share the same memory space , best for i/o bound task\n",
    "    multiprocessing- uses separate processes each process has its own memory space\n",
    "    -best for cpu bound tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10 what are the advantages of using logging in program\n",
    " -> logging helps track the flow of a program and understand what happend and when\n",
    "    - logging can include timestamps log levels and contex\n",
    "    - helps to track issues over time even after program has stoppes\n",
    "    - can be turned on or off filtered by level without changing code\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11 what is memory management in python\n",
    " -> memory management is the process by which a programming language allocate and deallcates memory for variables \n",
    "    object and data during program execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12 what are the basic steps involves in exception handling in python\n",
    "-> 1 use try block - it can block code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    python execute this block normally unless an exeception occurs\n",
    "   2 use except block - it can catch and handle the exception\n",
    "   3 use else block - runs only if no exeception occurs in the try block\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13 why is memory management important in python\n",
    " -> 1 it improves performance\n",
    "    2 to handle large program \n",
    "    3 t0 use ram efficently or efficint use of resources\n",
    "    4 if memory not managed properly unsused objecr ramain in memory causing memory leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14 what is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
    " -> try - block the code that might raise exception, \n",
    "         execute fisky code and monitor for exception \n",
    "    except - handle errors safely and prevent program from crash\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15 how does python garbage collection system work\n",
    " ->  the garbage collector runs periodically \n",
    "      it looks for unreachable object \n",
    "      it find cycles it breaks them and frees memory \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q16 what is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
    " -> runs only if on exception occurs in the try block \n",
    "   - keeps code clean you can separate the code that might fail from the code should run everything went good\n",
    "   - avoid catching unintended exception\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17 what are the common logging levels in python\n",
    "-> 1 critical - very serious error that may prevent the program from continuing\n",
    "   2 error  - run time error that should be addresed\n",
    "   3 warning - something unexpected happened but program \n",
    "   4 info - general information about program execution \n",
    "   5 debug - detailed diagnostic information for debugging purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18 what is the difference between os.fork and multiprocessing in python\n",

    "  child get copy of the parent memory\n",
    "  -multiprocessing - is a high level python module for creating proceses\n",
